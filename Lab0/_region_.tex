\section{Introduction}

The aim of this lab was to measure the volume of two objects: a cube, and a cylinder. To obtain the volume of these objects, three different measurement tools were used: a roll tape measure, a ruler, and precision calipers.

To measure the volume of the cube, three measurements were taken: length, volume, and width. However, since the measuring tools are not perfect, the volume has to be calculated as $V_{cube}=LHW+\sigma_{v}$, where $\sigma_{v}$ is the error propagation.
